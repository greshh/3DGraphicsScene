# 3DGraphicsScene
***Start:** September 29<sup>th</sup> 2023, **Finish:** October 30<sup>th</sup> 2023*

For a second-year course: Graphical Programming

This program generates a 3D graphics scene comprising of planar and spherical surfaces, unleashing creativity with what can be created with these two types of surfaces.

## Scenario
The scene contains:
- A plane surface with a texture pasted on it
- A uniform colour sphere with a shiny surface (ie. specular highlight)
- A sphere with a texture pasted on it
- The visible faces of a uniform colour cube correctly placed and shaded. The cube is located in an arbitrary position in the scene - not aligned with the principle axes in the world coordinates.

In my graphical scene, it contains a teddy bear consisting of textured rectangular "cubes" and spheres sitting on a block of wood with a shiny ball and two cubes (one is a Rubix cube) in a textured room.

## What I learnt:
- Coordinate transformations (in homogeneous coordinates)
- Ray tracing
- Illumination
- Shading
- Texture mapping
